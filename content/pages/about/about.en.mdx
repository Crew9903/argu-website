<Hero title="argü" kicker="Collective" subtitle="Art is Everywhere" />

Born in **Caracas**, shaped in **Madrid** and **Berlin** — argü collective began as a clothing project and evolved into a creative movement.  
A blend of streetwear, culture, and storytelling.  
We explore how design, music, and community merge into one language.

<Callout tone="success">
argü is a collective for experimentation.  
We design pieces, visuals, and moments that reflect where we come from and where we’re heading.

    <h3>How we work</h3>
    <p>Each drop, shoot, and story is built around collaboration.  
    We value process over perfection — what matters is movement, not polish.</p>
    <p>Everything is made in small quantities, meant to feel personal and lived in.</p>
